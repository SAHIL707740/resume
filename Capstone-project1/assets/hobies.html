<p>As a software engineer, my hobbies extend into the realm of technology and innovation.
     I enjoy participating in hackathons and coding competitions to continuously challenge and improve my programming
      skills. Outside of coding, I have a keen interest in exploring new technologies and keeping up with the latest 
      trends in the tech industry. I also enjoy collaborating with others on open-source projects, as it allows me to
       contribute to the community while learning from other talented developers. Additionally, I find relaxation and 
       inspiration in reading tech blogs and attending tech meetups and conferences to stay connected with the larger 
       tech community.</p>
